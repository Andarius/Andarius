### Bonjour 👋, I'm Julien


I'm a Software Engineer from Paris 🇫🇷, sometimes working from beautiful Sicily 🇮🇹.  

I set up several Datalake and have a main focus as a Data Engineer, but I like to understand how things work and try new technologies, mainly using TypeScript (for React / React Native apps) and Python (for Data / ML related stuff or backend services).

I'm currently working in my free time on Obitrain, a sport app that allows you to create your own sport trainings.
You can also share them with your friends, connect your devices & more.
